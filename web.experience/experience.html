      <h1>Mini app design club (2020 - 2021)</h1>
    

      <a style="font-size: 150%;">Being part of this club was one of the most interesting extracurricular experiences of high school.
         The most used programming languages we used to build mini apps were HTML, CSS, Java Script. The Countdown Timer and Rated Movie app are two of the projects 
         I worked on during this time.</a>
        <h1>Mentorship Club (2021 - 2021)</h1>
        <a style="font-size: 150%;">Since secondary school my friends used to ask me to explain them the lecture or the solution of any difficult homework, and this continued until in high school my physics teacher wanted me to explain to my classemates anything they found difficult during the lecture. </a>
        <br>
        <a style="font-size: 150%;">Because of the good reviews from my classmates, the English teacher asked me to be part of the Mentorship club to help tenth and eleventh grade students after lesson.</a>
        <br>
        <a style="font-size: 150%;">I consider these two as remarkable experiences, not just because of the pleasure of helping others and watching them get better session after session, but also becuse I could see the missing junction point, the reason why students couldn't see the results of their long hours of studies.</a>
      <h1>Volunteer work, Klubi Shpresa (Hope club)</h1>
      <a style="font-size: 150%;">The biggest charity funding club of my high school, which with the help of the tachers in response to this organisation collects monetary and non-monetary aid for disabled people and those in need. </a>
